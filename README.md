#Multithreaded Production Flow Simulation

This project is a multithreaded simulation of a production flow to produce a final product consisting of two components, Component-A and Component-B. The simulation involves threads representing each step of the production process, including component production, assembly, packing, and labeling. The program is designed to run in an infinite loop, simulating a continuous production process.
